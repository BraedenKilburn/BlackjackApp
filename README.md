# Project 1: Blackjack App

### Author: Braeden Kilburn

I created a blackjack app for my project 1 assignment and, let me tell you, that took a lot of work! I aimed to stick to all the requirements that I had outlined in the project 1 proposal specifications; however, there are a few points that I wasn't able to accomplish because either I didn't have time or I couldn't figure it out.

I believe that I did an outstanding job creating an interface that is easy for all players to use and understand. I believe that I made a functioning game that people would be willing to play longer than a couple minutes (this is due to the theme store I implemented). I seriously believe I was able to go above-and-beyond for this project as I had to start from complete scratch compared to other students who had a working product to start with.

## Requirements

&#9745; Implement a game of blackjack where the user is the only player besides the dealer

&#9745; The standard scoring rules for blackjack will apply (see Bicycle Cards “How-To-Play” for Blackjack)

&#9744; As the user draws (“hits”) cards:

- &#9744; The cards will “fly-in”
  - The initial deal cards "fly-in" but I couldn't figure out how to get the new cards that were added to my array to fly-in without having the whole hand fly-in again.
- &#9745; With a card woosh audio

&#9745; The user will have a running score ("credits") that begins at $500

&#9745; The table minimum is $10 and the table maximum is $500 (user increments their bets by $10)

&#9744; In addition to card assets, there will be chip assets that are visual representations of your current bet

- &#9745; I was able to find [free card assets from Google](https://code.google.com/archive/p/vector-playing-cards/downloads)
- &#9744; I could not find free casino chip assets and did not have time to make my own

&#9745; The user will be able to change the blackjack table theme (table top) color

&#9745; As the game play progresses, use all the real estate on the screen in an efficient manner. Cards should get smaller (or larger) as more (or fewer) appear on-screen at the same time, while always using as much space as is available and still being nicely arranged

&#9745; Implement a menu where the user may adjust settings (e.g., audio on/off, theme), reset their wallet, start a new game, view game history

&#9745; The user may “cash-out” their funds for different table themes

&#9745; If the user resets their wallet, it will reset the unlocked table themes and any progress made so far

- &#9745; This would need a confirmation popup to avoid user “slips” that erase their progress

&#9744; Should work in both landscape and portrait mode

- From a design perspective, I thought that it should remain in portrait mode as it looked better that way.
